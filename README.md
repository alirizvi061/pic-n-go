# Pic-N-Go

## Overview

Pic-N-Go is an app which allows the users to create a bucket list for their adventures using API information from the Flickr API. To start, users have to create an account using a username, email, and password. This allows the user the ability to add searched pictures to their bucket list with notes regarding their trip.

## Approach

My approach for this project was centered around creating a bucket list for all of my adventures! I wanted to make it easier for users to be able to search pictures using the Flickr API and adding these pictures directly to the user's bucket list with notation ability. Each user's information is secure in their accounts and only they can see the pictures they add and the notes they've put for each picture. 

I started the project with the idea of creating the functionality first then the styling. This allowed me to spend time learning how to administer functionality without have the aid of the front end, I used the Postman app to check whether the backend routes were working or not before I created the front end routes using axios. I wanted every user to have their own profile so each user can have the ability to create their own bucket list, so I spent time creating user authentication and edited the user schema based on the needs of the app. After creating all of the functionality I started created the CSS layout and putting together the design elements to make the app look modern, user friendly and minimalistic. 

For my project management I used Trello Board, this deemed beneficial in the success of my project's completion. Although I have used Notion for my previous projects, Trello allowed me a more user friendly user interface, the ability to drag and drop my items, and color coordinate them based on completion status. Using Trello allowed me to stay up to date with my planning for the day, keeping track of bugs, and staying up with the progress of the entire app. It also kept my code file clean from psuedocode because I was able to plan my approach using Trello. 

## Version 2

In the future, I'd like to add the following functionalities: 

- Create "Edit" functionilty for the user notes. 
- Posible 'Google Maps API' integration for easy access to search and navigate to bucketlist item locations.
- Create Permissions for who can/can't delete and edit products.
- Create "Favorites" functionality for the list items.
- Create "Folders" functionality for the list items.
